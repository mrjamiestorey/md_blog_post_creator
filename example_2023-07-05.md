The fifth day of my daily series in 2023.

<!--more-->

I missed a few days of writing but there wasn't much of interest to write about. On Monday 3rd July I thought I had spent all my Azure free trial credit in one day because the Azure Portal gave me a notification saying I had spent it all.

I thought I had accidentally used it all on the Form Recognizer that I was using because they do have a Â£158 per 1000 pages option.

I had to wait until 24 hours had passed to find out it was just a visual glitch and I still have it all. Azure always seems to have little problems like that every time I use it...Annoying.

At least now I can continue trying out some more products. I'll probably follow through some Microsoft Learn paths whilst I have the chance to use my credit.  

Today I spent 4 hours on a task that I should have completed over 1 year ago ðŸ™‚. I entered all of my football guesses for league one 2021-2022 season into a spreadsheet.  

I made a spreadsheet using Python and Pandas, I made a dataframe by loading the json file and used the dataframe to excel function. I already had the JSON file of the results saved from last year.  

I still have the Premier League and EFL Cup to do as well. It's annoying how it only took 4 hours and I've been putting it off so long. It could have been even quicker if I had designed the form better.  

The order of the fixtures on my sheet of paper were different to the ordering of the fixtures from the API. I had to keep looking up to the spreadsheet to see which teams I'm looking for next rather than just following the order of what's on the paper.

It was tedious to enter the data but I made it a little easier by using AutoHotkey to swap my right arrow key to work as the tab key. That way I used my numpad to enter the scores and then "tabbed" 4 times and after hitting enter I was returned to my next row at the correct column. Otherwise without that I would have to either use the actual tab key on the opposite side of the keyboard which didn't feel right or I would have to use the mouse to click back into the correct column which is obviously not ideal for efficiency.  

I can now work out how many points I really scored by adding in a formula to determine the amount of points to receive.  

Afterwards I forgot to disable the AutoHotkey script and was wondering why my Powershell suggestions were not working correctly. It usually suggests something to auto complete and you press the right arrow key to accept the suggestion but it was just brining up the name of directories as if I was pressing the tab key ðŸ™ƒ.  

I have made a couple of silly mistakes this week which resulted in me spending money for a quick fix which wasn't needed.  
First I bought an Obsidian Vault template for a dataview plugin query because mine wouldn't return any logged notes. I had just forgotten to prefix the notes with "log::" as you're supposed to. I had spent 15 minutes wondering why it wasn't working.  

I also bought 1 month of Google Colab Plus because I thought I needed access to a terminal because my print() functions were not being displayed but they were never being executed in the first place due to my poor flow of the script.

What I've taken away from this is I should walk away from a problem sometimes rather than just trying to solve it in any way possible, especially when time is not an issue.
